# Example App using weather forecast api

This will be recreation pf my very first published app.

## Assumptions

Weather api used **openweathermap**. More than 5 day forecast.

Single input field for city search with country single select.

Display all necessary information for upcoming days.

A simple UI based in material-ui library.

Unit test as needed.

## Obstacles

Open weather api in free plan is limited, 
we need some latitude and longitude data to fulfill our use case.

## Solution

In this case **opencage** api will give us those data.

## Setup for run locally
